Requirements:

-github repository with source code.
-tech stack: JavaScript (selected framework such as Node.js, React, Vue.js, Angular, Ember.js), JSON - backend (database), CSS
-showcase the application (online)
-review the application
-time to work on application: 17 August - 20 August 2023
-example to look at for reference: http://phonebooks.z1.web.core.windows.net/
-formatting of the numbers must be: 081-365-9535


Rough idea of how the database works:

Phone_book table:
phone_book_name - primary key
full_name 
phone_numbers - unique

The SQL can work as follows:

Search function:
-search for phone_book_name AND (name OR number)

Add person:
-phone_book_name
-full_name
-phone_numbers

Add phone_book:
-phone_book_name


What if the person had more than 1 number? For example, a person could have a work, home, mobile and travel number, what could be done then? Maybe another table can be created using their name as a key.
