REACT NOTES:
npm start - starts the development server
npx create-react-app app-name - creates the react-app-folder
node_modules folder: 3rd party libraries such as React are installed.
public folder: public assets of the website exist such as images, video files etc.
src: source folder which contains the source code of the application. We start off with a component called App.js
index.js: a basic template that is bundled with the project folder the first time it is created. It has an id of root which is the container for the application. Then there is a script element below that references /src/main.js which is the entry point of the application. 
package.json: this folder contains information about the project. Such as the name, its version, script, the list of dependencies, and development dependencies (which are not being deployed with the application in the future.) 

CREATING A REACT COMPONENT:
-create a new file in the src folder and name it for example page_1.js
-create a function based react component (it is recommended for new projects.)
-class components can be used alternatively.
-save the file and go to App.js
-remove the contents of the App.js file
-import the new react component at the top and call it in the App function. Save the file.

DOWNLOADING JSON SERVER:
json-server is an npm(Node Package Manager) module, used for creating a mock REST API effortlessly. Data is transferred in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format between client and server.

npm install -g json-server : used to install json server

USING JSON SERVER:
create a file called db.json and add the table and its details.
save the file.
open command prompt as administrator and locate the project folder, mine was: C:\xampp\htdocs\eBlocks_Internship\phone-book-app\src
type the following: json-server db.json
then open a webpage on: http://localhost:3000
Ctrl + C is used to stop the json server
